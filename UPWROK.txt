I am a young developer with a bachelors in software engineering eager to start using my skills and knowledge in my field on new projects, which I plan on committing to via upwork. 
I have extensive experience and knowledge in development of desktop, web and mobile applications, along with system deployment and administration.
My experience in web development includes development of web shops, blogs, online teaching course applications, a social network for sharing notes/stories, etc. All were built with either Python with Django and Flask, ASP.NET, or PHP.
I've worked on development of many desktop applications in C# for libraries, markets and I even played a role in development of systems for airports.
I have also built a few android applications which use API's provided by the aforementioned web applications. 
You can also count on me when it comes to development of games with Unity, 3D modelling with Blender and photo editing in Photoshop.
I believe that my true worth as a freelancer comes not only from my diverse set of skills, but also from my absolute commitment to new projects I take up. 
I am truly in love with programming, which I hope you can see from my wide set of skills.
Besides all the experience I've had in the field, and all the successful projects I've worked on, I believe my biggest strength is my tenacity and my love for the job. You can count on me 24/7 and I never stop working until the project is finished and the employer is in love with it.
I am also fluent in English and Python :).
